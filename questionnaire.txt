We used the following questions to collect data for our project - 

1) Do you have a private Instagram account?
2) For those who have private Instagram accounts- Do you have a Facebook/LinkedIn account?
3) Does your bio contain any personal information(Name, School/College, Age, etc) ?
4) Do you use your face/image on different social media platforms?
5) Do you think this whole privacy thing is blown out of proportion? Surely a single common person's data is of no interest to any big company?

Demographics of the people who took survey -
Mainly people from USA and India belonging in the age group of 13-25(Gen Zs)
